## Speech-to-Text Transcription

Transcription is implemented in the current pipeline, but it only runs when the input has an audio stream and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. The workflow uses `fluent-ffmpeg` for media handling and OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription.

### Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Input video"]
    B["Normalize"]
    C["Probe"]
    D{"Can transcribe?"}
    E["Extract audio"]
    F["Transcribe"]
    G["Skip transcription"]
    H["Write manifest"]

    A --> B
    B -->|"ffmpeg"| C
    C -->|"ffprobe"| D
    D -->|Yes| E
    D -->|No| G
    E -->|"ffmpeg"| F
    F -->|"Whisper API"| H
    G --> H
```

### Tools In Use

- `ffmpeg` via `fluent-ffmpeg` for transcoding and audio extraction
- `ffprobe` via `fluent-ffmpeg` for duration, frame count, and stream detection
- OpenAI Whisper API for transcription
- `fs` and `path` for local file and manifest handling

The manifest is written to `tmp/processed_videos/<timestamp>/.influenca.json` after each run.
